I have been taking some kinds of medicines every day for some diseases. So the reveiw and evaluation from some users about mediciens are very helpful. In this notebook, I tried EDA from the data of medichine evaluation.

The dataset consists of the following columns:

Medicine Name: The name of the medicine.

Composition: The chemical composition of the medicine.

Uses: The various medical conditions for which the medicine is used.

Side_effects: The potential side effects of the medicine.

Image URL: A URL to an image of the medicine.

Manufacturer: The company that manufactures the medicine.

Excellent Review %: The percentage of excellent reviews the medicine has received.

Average Review %: The percentage of average reviews the medicine has received.

Poor Review %: The percentage of poor reviews the medicine has received.
